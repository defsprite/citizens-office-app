# Citizens Office of Communications Safety

## the idea
**Citizens Office of Communications Safety** is a project by [Christoph Sassenberg](https://twitter.com/defsprite) and [Mark Durrant](https://twitter.com/M6_D6) created as part of the [3-Beards](http://www.3-beards.com/) [Digital Sizzle 9 Art Hackathon](http://techcitynews.com/event/digital-sizzle-9-art-hackathon/)

The **Citizens Office of Communications Safety**, is a fictional authoritarian government agency which monitors and displays all internet traffic in any public place. The project was created as a satirical response to recent new stories concerning the  NSA, GCHQ, and David Cameron's proposed pornography filter.

The project uses packet sniffing to detect traffic on a wireless network. This traffic is then filtered and pushed to a website displayed on an iPad mini in an wall mounted case.
